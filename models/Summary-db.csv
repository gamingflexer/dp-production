"Accomplishments
To WhomIt MayConcern, My nameis Vincent Hall,and I hatethe""One-Size-Fits-All""approach to business. Whenmarketing doesn't feellike marketing,and people organically connect to your message, you've birthed a movement.
Gonearethe days ofthe 1950's whereindividualismrooted in autonomy allowed oneto belabeled as the""lone wolf""and heroically
conquer the""Corporate Ladder"".
Similarly, businessentitiescannotsurvivethecurrent globalized, hyper-competitive market through, what Icall, ""Corporate-Isolationism"".
Abusiness, whetherastart-up oran established titan ofindustry, mustalways find relevant waysconnectand communicate with its
audience.
My interest in business started whenmy friend's step-father told me""The only road to success is the one you build throughwork and
creativity"".
This statement has birthed a passion and driveto not only understand human behavior inwhatmotivates oneto buy, butalso the mechanics
behind product positioning. Whatabout the productmakes itappealing.
Howcan a business increase delivery efficiency.
Howdoesa business drive up profitmargins while driving down production costs?In conclusion, betweenmy experiencein accounting,
marketing research, marketing strategy, product positioning, marketcommunication,and publicrelations has led meto believetwo key
things.
First, individual's desireto buy hinges on theappealing presentation.
It has to be palatableto allfivesenses within 30 seconds or less.
Second, the productmustserveacustomer's need longer than the next fade of products.
In other words, the productmust withstand acompetitor's product in offering versatile utility and adaptability options to every customer.
It is my hopethatmy communication skillsalongwithmy experienceinmarketing, sales,and accountingwillassist in yourcompany's
profitability in product positioning.
