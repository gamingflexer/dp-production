About
After starting to code in C++ in junior college, my interest in python grew and now I am a Python enthusiast with a strong will to learn something new about the language everyday. Most of the projects I have worked on personally are made using Python frameworks. My interests also include Web development using Django backend and HTML/CSS/JS frontend. Looking for opportunity to start out in the industry in Python Development. Currently learning AI and Machine Learning. Other languages I am a bit comfortable include C and C++. Apart from coding, I have moderate skills in Graphic Designing using Adobe PS and Illustrator. Some extracurricular activities I do include Chess, Badminton, Football, Peer tutoring.
